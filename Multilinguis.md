## Lore

### Background

* Originally a disembodied Soul that was inside of a powerful Sword that was Crafted by [Kawataro](Kawataro.md).
* Transferred into the corpse of [Rufferamin](Rufferamin.md) when [Genesis](Genesis.md) killed him with the sword and a piece of it lodged in his body.
* Came to life a few days later in the transformed body of [Rufferamin](Rufferamin.md).
* Made an alliance with [Rufferamin](Rufferamin.md) almost immediately.
* Met newcomer [Admin](Admin.md) and followed her around curiously.
* Abandoned by [Rufferamin](Rufferamin.md) when he found out she had watched [Admin](Admin.md) steal from various people, including him.
* Met with [Kawataro](Kawataro.md), who told her of the fight between [Rufferamin](Rufferamin.md) and [Genesis](Genesis.md) and pointed out that she had no pulse. She would later forget this encounter.
* Decided to kill [Admin](Admin.md) to win [Rufferamin](Rufferamin.md) back.

### Sword Arc

* Went to [Genesis](Genesis.md) for help in taking down [Admin](Admin.md).
* Learned about the Sword and asked to see it. When [Genesis](Genesis.md) obliged, she took it for herself and became blood-thirsty, trying to kill [Admin](Admin.md).
* Visited [Kawataro](Kawataro.md) and remembered all that they had discussed, including that he had made the sword and trapped souls in there. [Kawataro](Kawataro.md) egged her on until she killed him.
* Later that day, she went after [Admin](Admin.md), who was defended by [Morgan](Atiredstudent) and [Genesis](Genesis.md). She killed [Morgan](Atiredstudent), then [Genesis](Genesis.md).
* While pursuing [Admin](Admin.md), Multi is stabbed by the Sword, which has a mind of its own.
* Brought back to life by [Admin](Admin.md) and taken to _Here_, an island labratory where she can be kept safe.

### Prison Arc

* [Admin](Admin.md) studied Multi in the laboratory. During this time, Multi had several terrifying hallucinations.
* [Admin](Admin.md) allowed Multi to move from the laboratory to the surface of _Here_ once she thought Multi was safe.
* Blew up _Here_, hallucinating that [Admin](Admin.md) had done it and then tried to kill her.
* Fled from _Here_, pursued by [Admin](Admin.md) who tried to get her to calm down.

### Revenge Arc

* Met [Genesis](Genesis.md), who she told of [Admin's](Admin) supposed manipulation of her and convinced to help kill [Admin](Admin.md).
* On the failure of the machine meant to kill [Admin](Admin.md), Multi ran into her base to enact her backup plan. She hesitated, however, inadvertently saving [Admin's](Admin) life.
* [Admin](Admin.md) summoned _The Entity_ to kill her, but Multi stood in defense of [Admin](Admin.md), realizing she didn't want her dead. [Admin](Admin.md) died anyway.
* Later tried to kill herself to rid the world of the threat she posed, however _The Entity_ made her immortal.
* Burnt by [Kawataro's](Kawataro.md) sword, which she had stolen off his body when she killed him.
* Left [Kawataro's](Kawataro.md) sword in a chest at spawn, along with her armour which she felt was suffocating her.

#### Immortal Arc (Ongoing)

* Joined [Izzy](Izzy.md) at Spider Lily Village where they started the flower cult.
* Discovered a portal at [Almost's](AlmostHilarious.md) base alongside [Izzy](Izzy.md). _The Entity_ adamantly tried to desuade them from going through it, even breaking the portal. _The Entity_ then gives them one chance to find an item and unlock the portal. [Izzy](Izzy.md) tried two items and is killed for cheating, while Almost used a beacon and was allowed to fall asleep instead.
* Performed a ritual to bring [Izzy](Izzy.md) back to life.
* Realized [Kawa](Kawataro.md) had been following them and had a conversation with him about immortality, punishments, and _The Entity_ before being made to turn away from him in anger and thus forget he was there.
* Ran into [Trevor](Trevor.md) and a second portal at spawn. Helped him pass through it.
